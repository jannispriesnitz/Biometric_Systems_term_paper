\todo[inline]{ungemorpht vorvergleichen}
In this paper we focussed on the capabilities of morphing visually similar subjects together. The selection if "visual similarity" is based on our own personal estimations. An approach to achieve even smaller distances of morphs could be to compare a subject to a plenty of other subjects with OpenFace and then morph the two closest togehter.

Another possibility would be to hide two subjects in a morph with the approach of morphing tree photos together. 
\todo[inline]{Visual inspection}


Sooner or later all subjects and passports are visually inspected by a border control officer, so a morph should hold against this verification, too. An interesting question is, until which level humans are able to reveal morphed pictures.
