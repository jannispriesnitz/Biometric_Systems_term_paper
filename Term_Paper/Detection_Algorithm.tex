\section{Detection algorithm} % alternativ Test setup?
As face detection algorithm the open source software OpenFace was selected. OpenFace is based on a neural network with is fully trained and has high convidence rates in the shipped version. Because OpenFaces main goal is to detect faces on arbitrary photos, the expected accurracy level i expected to be higher if it works on ICAO compliant data sets. 

\subsection{Process of work}
30 photos of one sequence \newline
compare every morph with picture one and picture two
