\label{Conclusion}
In our work we were able to show that it is feasible to attack automated border controls by morphing the ICAO compliant photos of two subjects together. The ABC recognizes both of them as one person. Moreover we found out that with the suggested threshold of OpenFace (0,999), there is a huge number of morphs which is detected as both of the to subjects. Because of this reason we suggested a new threshold of $~0,71$. 
Another interesting fact is that manual morphing does not lead to much better result than automatic morphing in general, but has a much higher standard deviation. Facing this, automatic morphing with a sanity check of the match rates could be an approach for generating a huge number of morphs in little time. 
In contrast to this manual morphing has a quite promising standard deviation, especially if two similar subjects are morphed. It should be seen that it takes about 40 minutes to achieve one high quality manual morph with GIMP GAP but in the case of visual inspection they are much harder to reveal.
