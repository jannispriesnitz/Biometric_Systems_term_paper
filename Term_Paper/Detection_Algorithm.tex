\section{Face detection}

\subsection*{Detection algorithm} % alternativ Test setup?
As face detection algorithm the open source software OpenFace was selected. OpenFace is based on a neural network with is fully trained and has high convidence rates in the shipped version. Because OpenFaces main goal is to detect faces on arbitrary photos, the expected accurracy level i expected to be higher if it works on ICAO compliant data sets. 

\subsection*{Process of work}
Both of the two source photos and the sequence of 30 morphs is given as input to the OpenFace comparison algorithm. OpenFace computes the match rate of every morph to both of the two photos. 
The expected outcome of comparison algorithm is an almost equal match rate for morph no. 15, where both pictures are represented to $50\%$. The closer the morph gets to one of the original pictures the higher the match rate and the lower to the other picture.
