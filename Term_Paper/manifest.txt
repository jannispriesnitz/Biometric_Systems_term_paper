This file specifies what the EMISA Bundle consists of; more
precisely, it explains how the locutions "Work" and "Compiled Work",
used in the LaTeX Project Public License, are to be interpreted
in the case of this work.

MEANING OF THE TERM "Work"
==========================

In the case of the EMISA Bundle, the "Work" is the collection of the 
following 4 files:

README.md     --  start by reading this file
manifest.txt  --  the file you are reading now
emisa.dtx     --  main source file
emisa.ins     --  installation script

If you have received the 4 files listed above, you possess an integral copy 
of the EMISA Bundle.



MEANING OF THE TERM "Compiled Work"
===================================

In the case of the EMISA Bundle, a "Compiled Work" is the collection of:

a) the following 2 files that are also part of the "Work" (see above):

README.md
manifest.txt


AND
b) the following 5 files:

emisa.cls                 --  LaTeX document class
emisa.bbx                 --  biblatex bibliography style
emisa.cbx                 --  biblatex citation style
emisa.pdf                 --  class documentation
emisa-author-template.tex --  template for authors

The file `emisa.pdf' is obtained by submitting to the 
program pdflatex the file `emisa.dtx', following the same steps as 
those explained in `README.md' under the title "How to generate the 
documentation".


CTAN-Release
============
For a more convenient access a symbolic link to emisa.pdf called emisa-instructions.pdf is added to the archive for CTAN.


COMMENT
=======

Please remember that, in order to distribute a LPPL-compliant copy of the 
EMISA Bundle, it suffices to distribute only the 4 files that constitute 
the "Work".
